The Dobson brothers jamming out some ARKit applications as side projects.

This version adds two dots to the scene and presents how far(in meters) those dots are in the world from each other. You click once on/near a "feature point" and select another to see the distance between the 2 dots. As you move the phone around, the label that displays the measurement will follow the point of view of the camera so the user can easily see the measurement values at all times. You can do this as many times as you'd like while the app is in session.
