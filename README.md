The Dobson brothers jamming out some ARKit applications as side projects.

This version detects horizontal planes, alerts you every time a plane is detected by presenting a label with the total # of planes detected during the current AR session, and displays a grid on top of each plane detected. Every time a new plane is detected with the same anchor, a new, larger, plane is presented to the scene. Upon tapping any plane surface added to the scene, a 3D car is added on top of that plane. Add as many cars as you want!
