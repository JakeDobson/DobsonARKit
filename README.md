This version adds a plane, box(es), and spotlight to the scene. There is a toggle switch to add/remove the visibility of the plane. At a certain point in the plane, the box(es) do(es) not catch the spotlight and will appear black(if out of the spotlight range), or white with shadows and lighting effects(if in the spotlight range).
