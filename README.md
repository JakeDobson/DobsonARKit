This version adds 3 models to the scene as .dae files. We imported the 3D .obj files we found on Google Blocks into Blender as .obj files, then exported them as one .dae file to our computer, then dragged into Xcode. The firetruck had way too many nodes, so we had to flatten the node into one single node while hopeing Xcode wouldn't crash! It's pretty nice to be able to submit dae files as a group like this; allows for some adjustments before, during, and after importing to Xcode. Obviously, it's very nice to add all objects of the 3D scene to the ARScene all at once!
